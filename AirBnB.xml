    <!-- ON THE DESIGN CHOICE OF DECLARING ACTIONS
	 
At first, it seems that instead of defining actions in XML, we can
gain more flexibility by designing it in a way that they are returned
dynamically, e.g. by callbacks. There are cases where such flexibility
is desirable, for example, when the availability of an action or even
the name of it depends on token status or external input (availability
of a server, for example). But that doesn't contradict with the design
of defining actions in XML, since an action defined in XML can be
enabled or disabled by javascript code when the need
rises. Furthermore, defining actions as separate entity, outside of
the javascript code have the advantage that they can be influenced by
user-agent policy (e.g. a policy of "never attest identity" leads to
certain actions being disabled instead of Dapp hanging there in a
deadlock), easily examined for breaches (an action that is not defined
and signed will not appear as a result of program execution), easily
understood by the wallet (e.g. a wallet can examine an action that
leads to outgoing transfer of value before the user start the action)
and finally, easily translated.
    -->

    <!-- ON THE DESIGN CHOICE OF DEFINING ACTIONS ON TOKEN TYPE, NOT
         ON INDIVIDUAL TOKEN INSTANCES

Imagine an international traveller with 3 bookings in Indonesia,
Singapore and Malaysia, with a huge back pack and a luggage bag in his
hand in front of a smart lock. He should not have to fiddle with his
mobile, choosing the right booking to unlock the smart lock.

The actions and conditions are not mapped to individual instance of
AirBNB booking, but with a type of asset in whole. The same is true
for most digital asset (non-fungible token) types - the selection of
token for the action should be automatic if it can be automated.
    -->
    
    
    <action call="always"> <!-- always display a call-to-action -->
        <!-- Display this action even when the user don't have a valid
             booking. Some users feel nervous if they couldn't find
             the button to display a QR code before their travel time.
             Let's give them the button and apologize when they hit
             it.  -->

        <name>Display QR code</name>
        <selection filter="(&amp;(checkinTime >= $NOW)(checkoutTime <= $NOW))"/>
        <noselection xml:lang="en">
            <!-- this message appears when the user hit Display QR
                 code call-to-action without owning a valid booking
                 -->
            <p>None of your booking is available now.</p>
	        <!-- there must be a way to generate a card at such
	             occassion, because some designers consider that a
	             user with no no valid token trying to use the
	             starting point of buying one such token. -->
        </noselection>
    </action>

    <!-- this action is triggered when the user places his mobile on the smart lock -->
    <action call="none" automatic="yes">
        <name>Enter via NFC</name>
        <!-- conditions can be defined here or handled by
             Javascript. Some conditions apparently has to be here, like
             this NFC one, since you can't loop a javascript event code
             forever in user's mobile phone just to wait for an NFC
             scanner -->
        <act on="NFC-sensored">
            <params><!-- parameters to match the NFC scanner --></params>
            <!-- the following message will never be displayed because
                 the action can't be triggered by user (see
                 display="none") -->
        </act>
        <noact xml:lang="">
            <p></p>
        </noact>
        <!-- the author might choose to not to specify the selection;
             instead, handle it through the javascript in the action
             card. I'll give an example:
	     
             In the case of a video game player with game assets, the
             author may choose to render a Horadric Cube for selecting
             items in an action called TRANSMOGRIFY. If she intends to
             do so, she needs to specify a selection rules here for
             the items that one can put in the Horadic Cube (almost
             everything) and let user choose what actual pieces to
             transmogrify in the action.
	     
             In this action, it is not needed.  since the logic to
             match an NFC scanner's ID with the token's lodging ID
             (the process to match if the user is trying to unlock the
             right AirBNB room) can be rather complex. -->
        <selection non-empty="">

        </selection> <noselection> <message xml:lang="en">No tokens
        that allows the use of this</message> </noselection> <when>
        <!-- the protocol to access the NFC scanner defined here -->
        </when> </action> <action display="always" </token>

# Introduction

The world wide web (The web) was made for information sharing.

The web lacks native support for the building blocks of today's Internet economy: authentication, transfer of value or trading, or express trusted relationship like Facebook friend introduction. Tim Berners-Lee envisioned the web a document platform. HTML, today mostly used to represent user interface, was originally a document format suitable for free information. The last decade saw the rise of modern programmable web browser technologies, aimed to allow various middlemen to provide what was missing in the blueprint of the web: Facebook to be entrusted with personal trust; Paypal to be entrusted to transfer value and Amazon to be entrusted for e-commerce trades.

Bitcoin, for the first time, made it possible to transfer of value without an intermediary. Built on its principles, Ethereum and proliferation of blockchain technologies enabled an expressive, trusted world computer, whose computational matrix is made of value, trust relationship and business rules, reliably providing outputs which, at this era, can only be procured through a myriad of institutions, overly-trusted corporations, leaky privacy protections and regulators.

(duplicate: These fundamental technologies allowed us to build a new web without trusted middlemen - in some scenarios, even completely without middlemen, as proven in the FIFA ticket trading experiment we conducted mid-2018.)

To participate, we need a global interface, a new world-wide-web, to the computer.

But the web was not ready for the change.

Vitalik envisions web3, the new web with blockchain and without a lot of middlemen. It provided, for the first time, the capacity for a web application to access Ethereum nodes.

However, Ethereum nodes are not the objects we can use to access the web. It's a tool that doesn't fit the ship of hands.

The old world-wide-web connects people through clicks, forms and search queries. The new world-wide-web, web3, carries trust around by the use of tokens and (cryptographic) attestations. But there lack the technology to allow tokens to interact with web applications. Today's popular concept, Dapp browser, is largely just a connector to blockchain nodes. It is oblivious of what tokens the user has, in what stages are the tokens being used (e.g. collateralised), or even how to display that toke in user's language. It cannot facilitate the way of interaction demanded by web3. 

In order to overcome the missing gap, Dapps work very hard to control what belongs to the users directly. A Dapp that sells pizza, for example, not only display the pizza and manage the shopping cart but also does a lot for the payment:

- loops through a list of known tokens that can be used to purchase the pizza;
- requests the user's public key, check the user's balance in each of those tokens, learning the user's wealth unnecessarily on the way;
- render a selection list for the user to choose a token;
- assemble the transaction using the user's choice of the token.

This approach, if compared to the good old world-wide-web, is like having the web applications to access the user's CPU and keyboard, reading input directly from the user's keystrokes. If the user upgrades his keyboard to a USB model, the web application has to update their code to understand a new type of keystrokes.

Similarly, in the current web3 model, if there is another token becomes popular, or even if the existing one changed their contract a bit to work around a security issue, the Pizza selling website would need to update their code.

This has the result of either making dapps expensive and hard to secure (current status) or give rise to cloud-based web-logic code centre who can update their code frequently and securely for the much smaller pizza shops, re-introducing a third party that has to be trusted.

Furthermore, the current status does not scale. It requires the web application having the full view of the underlying blockchain, which can't always be provided for security, privacy or bandwidth reasons. This is more prominent a problem when scalability technologies like Plasma enabling high-throughput blockchains and blockchains whose blocks are not public. It also didn't allow the user to use attestations (cryptographically signed directives), which serve purposes from event tickets, redeemable tokens to proofs - small proofs like friendship status proof (for a social network), big proofs like entire Merkle-trees, serious proofs like identity proof (for KYC). This is because despite such attestations behave like tokens in many ways, they do not live on the blockchain for privacy or bandwidth reasons.

# Magic Links

Magic links is simply a signed message for automic swap. It facilitates one major function of traditional financial institutions, a function called  "Delivery versus Payment", where one party, the buyer, pays in a currency and the other delivers an asset to be purchased. In today's financial world, delivery of physical goods is not a concern of the financial instutions. Once the transaction is done on paper or in computer, it is considered done. This assumption is built on the trust towards the financial instituions.

(Consider deletion: If, for example, the transaction consists of a loan in the form of currency and a car the loan is used to purchase, then the actual delivery of the car is out of concern, and both the buyer and the car seller are expected to follow what the computer tells them to do.)

# Assets

In TBML terminology, an asset is something that can be owned and has value. This is a broad definition of asset. It doesn't require, like the finanical assets, that an asset produces a return, or is anticipated to. This makes it possible for things like friendship to be defined as an asset. A token of friendship would be a signed message from someone, recognising some other as a friend, and it would be an asset in TBML terminology. Apparently a token of friendship from Michael Jackson can be of high value, especially since he cannot produce any more of these tokens, but even a humble token like "Friend of Weiwu" has some value. It, for example, allows a friend of Weiwu to sign a delivery recipt for him, or allows such a friend to get a mate-rate for signing up in the same dojo Weiwu practises in. There is even a neat trick, which, by using secret sharing protocols, having Weiwu's friendship token allows one to learn common friends shared with Weiwu. Notice that this definition does not require the asset to be a blockchain token, nor that it even exist on the blockchain. More on that in the latter chapter "attestation".

Assets can have financial value and utility value.

Examples of Assets with financial value:

Rental....

Airbnb ...

# Actions

Actions are things that can be done to an asset.

Regarding the financial properties of an asset, typical actions are transfer, sell, buy, collateralise, combine (e.g. in the case of cross-collateralisation), insure, auction and testify (obtain a signature of someone in order to satisfy certain trading requirements).

The other actions depends much on the utility properties of an asset, however, varies from one type of asset to another. AirBNB token, for example, would allow a user to open the smart-lock of their AirBNB room at the time it is reserved for. That's probably all the utility you can get from AirBNB token, but game assets, for example, can be equiped, unequiped, transmuted, transmogrified, enchanted, disenchanted, cursed, purged, socketed, unsocketed, broken-down, recycled, consecrated... Imagination is the limit.

Let's continue with the AirBNB example. If Alice owns a token that represents the right to use a room during certain time window, or "a booking" in user's terms, then the actions she could perform are:

Check-in - either produces a QR code to verify the booking to the landlord, or use an NFC-enabled phone to open a smart-lock.
